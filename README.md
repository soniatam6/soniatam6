# soniatam6.github.io

Personal site for Sonia Tam — built with **React + TypeScript + Vite**, styled with **Tailwind (shadcn tokens)**, and deployed on **GitHub Pages**.  
The project was scaffolded with **Lovable**, then I iteratively built it with **ChatGPT** for main content, component structure, layout, and deployment workflow.

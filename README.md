# soniatam6.github.io

Personal site for Sonia Tam — built with **React + TypeScript + Vite**, styled with **Tailwind (shadcn tokens)**, and deployed on **GitHub Pages**.  
The project was scaffolded with **Lovable**, then iterated with **ChatGPT** for component structure, layout, and deployment workflow, plus my own frontend tweaks.
